I created this in 2014 for IR clients that insisted on bringing in companies and technology I'd never heard of, instead of implementing the basic security recommendations related to the incident. Now, almost 4 years later, it still looks helpful! Though I'm going to guess that AT LEAST 50% of these names are taken, there are still some viable business ideas here to capture VC investment.

I hope you F9'ing love it or fn+:fast_forward:â€™ing love it if you're on a Mac.
